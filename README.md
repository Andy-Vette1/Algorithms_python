# Python Algorithms Practice

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to my personal practice of algorithms and data structures using Python. It includes implementations of classic algorithms, common data structures, and solutions to LeetCode problems.

The goal of this project is to provide clean, readable, and efficient Python implementations for educational purposes.

[//]: # (## Project Structure)

[//]: # (The repository is organized into the following directories:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (- **`data_structures/`**: Implementations of fundamental data structures &#40;e.g., Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Stacks, Queues&#41;.)

[//]: # (- **`sorting/`**: Common sorting algorithms &#40;e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort&#41;.)

[//]: # (- **`leetcode/`**: Solutions to specific LeetCode problems.)

[//]: # (- **`tests/`**: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithms.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher is recommended.

### Installation & Setup
It is best practice to run this project within a **virtual environment** to keep your global Python environment clean.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Andy-Vette1/Algorithms_python.git
   cd Algorithms_python

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    You can set this up easily in PyCharm (Settings > Project > Python Interpreter > Add Local Interpreter), or run the following commands in your terminal:
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Activate the virtual environment:
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies**
    This project primarily relies on the Python standard library. However, if you need to install any development dependencies (like pytest or numpy), run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
